# CS 485 X - Spring 2022

This is the initial Github repository for the CS 485 X Class of the Spring 2022 semester at St. Thomas Aquinas College. Please read below for the instructions for the first assignment:

# Step-by-Step Instructions

## Part 1: Git Basics
1. Navigate to the `assignment1` directory, command: `cd assignment1`
2. Create a new branch following the naming convention as described in the following command to type: `git checkout -b [email_username]-assignment1`
3. You should be already inside `assignment1` directory. You can verify using the following command: `pwd`. Create a new file, *[email_username]_submission.txt* and inside it write one of your favorite quotes or one of your goals for this semester
4. Save the file (Ctrl+S) and verify that git is recognizing it as a new "Untracked file" by typing the following command: `git status`
5. Add the files to your working stack by typing the following command: `git add <entire path git provided to your file>/[email_username]_submission.txt`
6. Now, let's commit your work. Type the following command: `git commit -m "A brief but clear message that describes your work"`
7. Finally, it's time to share your work with your peers: `git push`. You may need to push upstream first. If that's the case, you'll received a message indicating this. Please follow the instructions provided in the prompt description
8. We'll wait for instructions from the Professor as you'd need to wait for everyone to submit their work

## Part 2: Collaborating with Peers
1. Go to your Github account and locate this repository by going to: https://github.com/paoga87/cs485-s22/
2. Create a pull request (follow class demo)
3. We'll wait for instructions from the Professor. We'd need to wait for everyone to submit their pull requests.
4. Once the Professor indicates, update your branch with all of everyone's work. Command: `git pull`

That's it! Congratulations! You've completed Git+GitHub's Assignment 1
